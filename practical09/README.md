## Practical 09

- The code in this practical is used to detect whether an n by n matrix is magic or not
- The magic_square.h file contains a function that checks whether a matrix is magic or not
- The main_stub.c file reads in files and dynamically allocates memory in C to create a 2D array of integers using pointers
- The magic_square.h function is called on in the main file to check the matrix file and the output indicates whether the matrix is magic or not
- To compile: gcc -o main main_stub.c
- To run: ./main
- Example output: 

./main
Enter file name: magic_square.txt
No. lines, 3
This is magic
