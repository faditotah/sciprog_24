# Practical04 ReadMe File

## Description
- The code in this practical computes the values of tan(x) from [0,60] degrees every 5 degrees
- In the second part the task from last week was converted into a function. Now there is a function to calculate the area under tan(x) [0,60] using the trapezoidal rule and an n-number of points

## Output

### Tan(x) Values
- Compile: gcc -o tans tanVals.c -lm
- Execute: ./tans

### Area under Tan(x)
-
